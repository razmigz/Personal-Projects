``` 

The model summary suggests that the two variables are significant in predicting the number of Chipotle Locations in a state.

It looks like the normality assumption of the residuals holds since the histogram is roughly bell shaped. Additionally, it looks to be centered around 0 with some constant variance $\sigma$.
